### 1. Duplicate Confirmation Email Problem

**File:** `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity:** High
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

**Issue**

* Users were receiving **two confirmation emails** for a single form submission.
* This caused confusion and seemed unprofessional.

**Cause**

* The `handleSubmit` function contained **two identical calls** to `supabase.functions.invoke('send-confirmation')`.

**Resolution**

```ts
// Removed the second redundant email sending block
const { error: emailError } = await supabase.functions.invoke('send-confirmation', {
  body: {
    name: formData.name,
    email: formData.email,
    industry: formData.industry,
  },
});
```

**Result**
✅ Only one confirmation email is now sent
✅ User trust improved
✅ Avoided unnecessary function calls and reduced backend load

---

### 2. Lead Submission Not Being Saved

**File:** `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity:** Critical
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

**Issue**

* Lead submissions appeared to work, but **no data was stored** in the database.
* This led to missing user leads and potential business loss.

**Cause**

* The insert logic to Supabase was missing.
* There was also no validation for duplicate email addresses.

**Resolution**

```ts
// Check if email already exists
const { data: existingLead, error: checkError } = await supabase
  .from('leads')
  .select('email')
  .eq('email', formData.email)
  .single();

// If not exists, insert new lead
const { error: insertError } = await supabase
  .from('leads')
  .insert({
    name: formData.name,
    email: formData.email,
    industry: formData.industry,
  });
```

**Result**
✅ Leads are now stored correctly
✅ Duplicate check prevents overwriting
✅ Proper error checks added for reliability

---

### 3. User Feedback via Toast Notifications

**File:** `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** ✅ Implemented

**Enhancement**

* Introduced toast notifications to inform users about the status of their submissions.

**Implemented Notifications**

```ts
// Success
toast({ title: "Success!", description: "Lead submitted successfully!" });

// Already exists
toast({ title: "Lead Already Exists", description: "This lead already exists.", variant: "destructive" });

// DB insert error
toast({ title: "Error", description: "Failed to save your information. Please try again.", variant: "destructive" });

// Unexpected error
toast({ title: "Error", description: "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again.", variant: "destructive" });
```

**Result**
✅ Users now get instant visual feedback
✅ Reduces uncertainty during form submission
✅ Smoother and more intuitive experience

---

### 4. Submission Button Spinner & Loading State

**File:** `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity:** Low (UX)
**Status:** ✅ Implemented

**Issue**

* Users could accidentally **submit the form multiple times**.
* No feedback indicated that the form was being processed.

**Resolution**

```tsx
// Track submit state
const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);

// In button
disabled={isSubmitting}
{isSubmitting ? (
  <>
    <Loader2 className="w-5 h-5 mr-2 animate-spin" />
    Submitting...
  </>
) : (
  <>
    <CheckCircle className="w-5 h-5 mr-2" />
    Get Early Access
  </>
)}
```

**Result**
✅ Button now reflects loading status visually
✅ Prevents repeated clicks
✅ Adds a polished touch to the user interaction
